  <h1>Davi's Minecraft Server</h1>
  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>I'm experimenting with an always-up minecraft server for family and friends. If you know me,
    then you're good to join! </p>
  <p>The server will be running on my old macbook pro, so it won't be incredibly powerful, but it'll
    be enough for us to have some fun and for me to test my technological abilities.</p>

  <h2>Etiquette</h2>
  <p>Be excellent to each other. Don't punch people, take stuff from their homes, break their
    builds, etc unless you have their explicit consent. I expect we'll have some combination of
    working together on one megabase and us each having our own base.</p>
  <p>Use nice language. This means that you should do your best to abide by "no swearing in my good
    Christian Minecraft server." It also means that you should use correct pronouns, refrain from
    insults and prejudice, and use language to appreciate and include others.</p>
  <p>You can play by yourself whenever you want and/or organize times to be playing with others;
    feel free to play when I'm not. If you notice a problem, whether it be griefing or that the
    server is down, please let me know.</p>

  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Minecraft Java version 1.20.1</li>
    <li>survival</li>
    <li>difficulty hard</li>
    <li>mob griefing turned off</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mods</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://botaniamod.net/index.html">Botania</a></h3>
  <p>This is the biggest mod here. It adds a tech tree, automation tools, and magic. It has an
    in-game guide craft-able by combining a book and a sapling.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://quarkmod.net/">Quark</a> (including oddities)</h4>
  <p>This adds a lot of subtle features to make minecraft better. You may wish to skim the full feature list on the
    website. Some highlights are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pipes</li>
    <li>Tetris-like enchanting mechanics</li>
    <li>Drop a little icon that holds all your stuff for you when you die rather than your stuff
      going BLEARGH all over.</li>
    <li>Inventory sorting and hot-deposit into chests</li>
    <li>Rope (deployable ladders that also move blocks)</li>
    <li>Right click a crop to harvest+replant. Use a hoe to harvest+replant large area.</li>
    <li>Ancient tomes (rare loot that lets you enchant things even more)</li>
  </ul>
