  <h1>Davi's Minecraft Server</h1>
  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>I'm experimenting with an always-up minecraft server for family and friends. If you know me,
    then you're good to join! </p>
  <p>The server will be running on my old macbook pro, so it won't be incredibly powerful, but it'll
    be enough for us to have some fun and for me to test my technological abilities.</p>

  <h2>Etiquette</h2>
  <p>Be excellent to each other. Don't punch people, take stuff from their homes, break their
    builds, etc unless you have their explicit consent. I expect we'll have some combination of
    working together on one megabase and us each having our own base.</p>
  <p>Use nice language. This means that you should do your best to abide by "no swearing in my good
    Christian Minecraft server." It also means that you should use correct pronouns, refrain from
    insults and prejudice, and use language to appreciate and include others.</p>
  <p>You can play by yourself whenever you want and/or organize times to be playing with others;
    feel free to play when I'm not. If you notice a problem, whether it be griefing or that the
    server is down, please let me know.</p>

  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <p>This will be a survival server, difficulty hard, with mob griefing turned off.</p>

  <h2>How do I join?</h2>
  <h4>Minecraft version 1.20.1</h4>
  <p>You will need Minecraft Java version 1.20.1 (sorry bedrock folks). You can install this from
    the Minecraft launcher.</p>
  <h3>Mods</h3>
  <p>The server will use the mods listed below, most of which you will need to install before you can join.
    You may choose to download each one individually, but you'll probably be better off if you download all but Forge from
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MtS3cXA33_4xE3crP9jTqfFgHgXPxC2U?usp=sharing">
      my google drive</a>. So in general, the instructions are</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start up the minecraft launcher, select version 1.20.1 (to the left of the play button), and
      run the game to make sure it is downloaded</li>
    <li>Download the latest stable version of Forge for Minecraft 1.20.1 and follow its instructions
      to install client (I used <a href="https://neoforged.net/">Neoforge 1.20.1-47.1.88</a>)</li>
    <li>Start up the minecraft launcher, select version 1.20.1-forge (to the left of the play button), and
      run the game to let Forge generate its necessary files and folders. You may desire to leave the game running for the next step.</li>
    <li>Locate your mods directory within <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/.minecraft">
      the directory from which Minecraft runs</a>. An easy way to do this it to (in the game's main menu) click on <code>Mods</code> and then <code>Open mods folder</code></li>
    <li>Download all the mods (and extract out of the zip file if applicable)</li>
    <li>Move the mods into your mods folder</li>
    <li>Close Minecraft if it's still open. Within the minecraft launcher, specify the correct minecraft/forge version (to the left of
      the play button)</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html">
    Forge</a></h4>
  <p>Neoforge also seems to work.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania/files">Botania</a></h4>
  <p>This is the biggest mod here. It adds a tech tree, automation tools, and magic. It has an
    in-game guide craft-able by combining a book and a sapling. You can
    <a href="https://botaniamod.net/index.html">read more about it on the website</a>.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark/files">Quark</a></h4>
  <p>This adds a lot of subtle features to make minecraft better. You may wish to skim
    <a href="https://quarkmod.net/">the full feature list</a>. Some highlights are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inventory sorting and hot-deposit into chests</li>
    <li>Rope (deployable ladders that also move blocks)</li>
    <li>More mobs</li>
    <li>Torch arrows</li>
    <li>Ancient tomes (rare loot that lets you enchant things even more)</li>
    <li>Right click a crop to harvest+replant. Use a hoe to harvest+replant large area.</li>
    <li>Villagers follow emeralds like cows follow wheat</li>
    <li>Monster boxes are scattered across the underground to make things spicy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The 1.20.1 version is available for download from their discord server (or my google drive)</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities/files">Quark
    Oddities</a></h4>
  <p>These are a few extra quark features that require a separate file to run because they're more
    different from vanilla, unmodded minecraft. It includes copper pipes, magnets,
    and dropping a little icon that holds all your stuff for you when you die rather than your stuff
    going BLEARGH all over.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones/files">Waystones</a></h4>
  <p>Waystones are teleport points. Very useful! When you get curious, look at
    <a href="https://mods.twelveiterations.com/mc/waystones/">the wiki</a>.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei/files">JEI (Just Enough Items)</a>
  </h4>
  <p>This lets you see how to craft things! Basic controls (in your inventory) are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Show Recipes: Hover over item + R</li>
    <li>Show Uses: Hover over item + U</li>
    <li>Toggle Item List Overlay: Control + O</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/appleskin/files">Appleskin</a></h4>
  <p>This changes the hunger display to better show the underlying game mechanics.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/explorers-compass/files">Explorer's
    Compass</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natures-compass/files">Nature's
    Compass</a></h4>
  <p>These let you craft special compasses to help you find things.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios/files">Curios</a></h4>
  <p>You have extra equipment slots accessed by hitting "g". The equipment for those slots comes
    from Botania.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/trade-cycling">Trade Cycling</a></h4>
  <p>Adds a button to villager GUI that does the equal process of them losing and regaining their profession.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/disenchantingforge">Disenchanting</a></h4>
  <p>Adds a block that moves enchantments form items to books.</p>

<!--  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-more-torch-spam">No More Torch Spam</a></h4>-->
<!--  <p>Adds glow crystals, which are better at lighting things up than torches.</p>-->

<!--  <h4><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/biomesyougo">Oh the Biomes You'll Go</a></h4>-->
<!--  <p>Changes world generation</p>-->

  <!--  <h4><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structory">Structory</a></h4>-->
  <!--  <p>Changes world generation</p>-->

  <h4>Dependencies</h4>
  <p>These code library mods are required by other mods we're using, but don't do anything in and of
    themselves.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zeta/files">Zeta</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ferritecore/files">Ferrite Core</a>
      (actually, this just boosts performance, isn't a dependency of other mods)
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balm/files">Balm</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli/files">Patchouli</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-api">Architectury</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config">Cloth Config</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Optional</h4>
  <p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/light-overlay/files">Light overlay</a> is
    client side only, so you don't have to have it. I find it convenient though, so I'll use it.</p>
  <h4>Server side only</h4>
  <p>These mods will be installed on the server, so it's good for you to be aware of them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/axes-are-weapons">Axes are Weapons</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/netherportalfix">Nether Portal Fix</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/datapack/tectonic">Tectonic</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/terralith">Terralithx</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/when-dungeons-arise">When Dungeons Arise</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Connecting to the server</h3>
  <p>The server is not up yet. I will put the address here when I am ready for people to join.
  <!--<p>You can add the server or connect to it directly by specifying the server address <code>minecraft.hawley.xyz</code>-->
